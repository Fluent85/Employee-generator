# Employee-generator

This is my first attempt at building a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.  
 

## Motivation

Practice node.js and learn more about this backend language.

## How to use? 

The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.  When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. 


## Issues and future development

Currently the application works, but still have issues with adding more than one team member.  Possibly adding a Linkedin profile option.
